When I created this blog a couple years ago I only very slightly modified the default Jekyll theme to provide a couple mobile optimizations, but it was always a distant intention to make the site a bit easier on the eyes.  Within the Jekyll framework, my desire has always been to:

* have a responsive site
* use as little javascript as possible
* stay compatible with GitHub Pages hosting

I didn't make the blog theme a priority (something that was super obvious if you saw the old theme).  Earlier this year a friend forwarded [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) to me - entirely because of the name.  It wasn't until this past weekend that I realized Lanyon met my theme requirements perfectly.

The transition process was painless.  I had to make sure a few of the customized styles I'd added flowed well with the new width, but that was a small hurdle.  I'd estimate it was much easier to migrate to the new theme than it was to create the blog with all its metadata.

Thanks to [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for the open source theme and time spent to make it available.
