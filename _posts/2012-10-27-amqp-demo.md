Last week I was catching up on some DevOpsCafe episodes and heard John mention a great presentation on AMPQ.  It reminded me of a session I'd attended at SpringOne a year earlier, but couldn't remember who had presented.  The session was about polyglot messaging with AMQP, and while I didn't fully appreciate it at SpringOne, the subject now perked my attention.  After some searching, I connected that dots that Rob Harrop, who John had mentioned, was also the presenter at SpringOne.  I watched the more recent presentation on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Multi-Platform-Messaging-with-RabbitMQ) and was inspired to send some messages of my own.

The [demo](https://github.com/lanyonm/amqp-demo) I created doesn't do a whole lot beyond what Rob did in his presentation, but it sufficed for a presentation I gave at work to illustrate the concept.  Unfortunately I don't see any immediate application for AMQP at work, but now that I've demoed some code, hopefully the barrier to build more has been broken.
